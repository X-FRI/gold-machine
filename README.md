A command-line application for predicting gold ETF and futures prices using machine learning.

## Supported Data Sources
> https://akshare.akfamily.xyz/index.html

### Gold ETF Data (Default)
- API Endpoint: `fund_etf_hist_em`
- Symbol: `518880` (GLD ETF)
- Data Fields: Date, Close price

### Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) Futures
- API Endpoint: `spot_hist_sge`
- Symbol: `Au99.99` (Gold futures)
- Data Fields: Date, Open, High, Low, Close prices

## Dependencies

- Deedle: Data manipulation and analysis
- MathNet.Numerics: Statistical computations
- Microsoft.ML: Machine learning framework
- Plotly.NET: Interactive charting
- Newtonsoft.Json: JSON parsing

## Usage

```bash
# Use default ETF data
dotnet run

# Use Shanghai Gold Exchange data
dotnet run sge
```

## Configuration

The system supports different configurations for each data provider:

### ETF Configuration (Default)
- API Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/public`
- Symbol: `518880`
- Start Date: `20000101`
- Training Ratio: 80%
- Risk-Free Rate: 0%

### SGE Configuration
- API Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/public`
- Symbol: `Au99.99`
- Start Date: `20000101`
- Training Ratio: 80%
- Risk-Free Rate: 0%

## Adding New Data Sources

To add a new data source:

1. Define Data Types in `Types.fs`:
   ```fsharp
   type RawNewDataSource =
     { [<JsonProperty("field")>]
       Field : string }

   type NewDataSourceResponse = RawNewDataSource[]
   ```

2. Update RawDataSource Union:
   ```fsharp
   type RawDataSource =
     | ETF of RawGoldETFData[]
     | SGE of RawGoldSGEData[]
     | NewSource of RawNewDataSource[]  // Add new case
   ```

3. Add DataProviderType:
   ```fsharp
   type DataProviderType =
     | ETFProvider
     | SGEProvider
     | NewProvider  // Add new provider type
   ```

4. Implement Data Provider in `DataProviders.fs`:
   ```fsharp
   type NewDataProvider() =
       interface IDataProvider with
           member this.Name = "New Data Provider"
           member this.ProviderType = NewProvider
           member this.FetchRawData config = // Implementation
   ```

5. Update Data Processing in `DataProcessing.fs`:
   ```fsharp
   let convertRawDataToRecords rawData =
     match rawData with
     | NewSource data -> // Handle new data format
   ```

6. Add Configuration in `Configuration.fs`:
   ```fsharp
   let getNewConfig () = // New configuration function
   ```

## Output

The system generates:
- Console logs with detailed progress information
- Performance metrics (R-squared, Sharpe ratio)
- Trading recommendations for the latest data
- Interactive HTML charts:
  - `gold_price_prediction.html`: Actual vs predicted prices
  - `cumulative_returns.html`: Strategy performance

## Machine Learning Pipeline

1. Data Acquisition: Fetch historical price data from selected provider
2. Data Processing: Convert raw data to standardized format and calculate technical indicators
3. Data Splitting: 80/20 train/test split
4. Model Training: Linear regression using SDCA algorithm
5. Prediction: Generate price forecasts
6. Strategy Evaluation: Calculate returns and risk metrics
7. Visualization: Create performance charts

## Trading Strategy

The system implements a simple momentum strategy:
- Buy Signal: When predicted price > actual price
- Hold Signal: When predicted price â‰¤ actual price

Strategy performance is evaluated using:
- Cumulative returns
- Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted performance)
- Win rate analysis
